# Dynamic Allocation of Resources in Cloud (DARC)

## Set up User
Create an IAM User of AWS, and call it darc. Assign it the correct policies (still have to figure out which ones).
Note: For now I just use the root account because I haven't figured out the policies yet of the user.

## Set up AWS CLI Profile
Install AWS CLI and add a profile with your new darc user.
